    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral (Paperwhite, Stone, Muted Steel Blue) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a clean, tab-based navigation system. The header contains links to switch between the three main literary works ("The Sands of Dee," "Time, You Old Gipsy Man," and "The Merchant of Venice"). Clicking a tab displays the relevant content and hides the others, creating a focused and organized user experience. Within each content section, questions and answers are presented directly beneath each other with distinct styling, removing the need for clicks and enhancing immediate readability and visual appeal. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The source material is entirely literary, so traditional data charts are not applicable. The primary goal is enhancing readability and direct consumption of text.
        - "The Sands of Dee" & "Time, You Old Gipsy Man" -> Goal: Present poetic works. -> Method: Poem text in a <pre> tag to preserve line breaks. Q&A presented directly with clear visual separation. -> Interaction: Users click a tab to view the poem, then read questions and answers sequentially. -> Justification: This respects the poetic structure and makes the analysis immediately accessible and visually distinct.
        - "The Merchant of Venice" -> Goal: Present a multi-part story. -> Method: The three-part story is grouped under a single tab, presented as prose with clear subheadings. Its Q&A is also presented directly. -> Interaction: Users navigate to the story and can read through the parts sequentially, with answers readily available for comprehension. -> Justification: Breaks down a longer narrative and its analysis into a cohesive section, optimized for continuous reading.
        - All visual elements are built with semantic HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS.

And call the cattle home, And call the cattle home Across the sands of Dee!"
The western wind was wild and dank with foam, And all alone went she.
The western tide crept up along the sand, And o'er and o'er the sand, And round and round the sand, As far as eye could see. The rolling mist came down and hid the land And never home came she.
"Oh! Is it weed, or fish, or floating hair,
A tress of golden hair, A drowned maiden's hair Above the nets at sea?
Was never salmon yet that shone so fair Among the stakes of Dee."
They rowed her in across the rolling foam,
The cruel crawling foam,
The cruel hungry foam,
To her grave beside the sea:
But still the boatman hear her call the cattle home Across the sands of Dee</pre>

                        <p class="text-md text-gray-500 mb-4">Unit 11, Lesson 9</p>
                        <div class="prose max-w-none text-lg leading-relaxed bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm">
                            <p>Once upon a time in Venice, Italy, there was a very rich merchant named Antonio. He had many ships that sailed in the sea. His ships carried different types of merchandise to other countries. He sold those goods there. He bought spices and other valuables from foreign countries and sold them in Venice.</p>
                            <p>Antonio was a good and kind man. He always helped the poor. The people of Venice loved him very much for his honesty and kindness.</p>
                            <p>Antonio had a close friend named Bassanio. He was a handsome young man and was born in a noble family. Bassanio liked to live a very luxurious life. He loved grandeur and style. He spent more money than he earned. As a result, he was very often short of money. In such situations, Bassanio would go to his best friend Antonio for help. Antonio would help him with cash.</p>
                            <p>It so happened that Bassanio fell in love with a wealthy lady named Portia. Portia was known not only for her beauty but also for her wisdom. He wanted to visit Portia in a grand manner but he did not have any money. So he went to Antonio. Bassanio said, "Dear friend Antonio, I am in great need of some money. I would like to visit Portia at Belmont, grandly dressed and with many servants."</p>
                            <p>Antonio said, "I don't have that much money with me now as all my ships have gone out in the sea with merchandise. But don't worry, my friend, I'll arrange three thousand ducats for you." So he decided to borrow the sum from a moneylender named Shylock. Antonio and Shylock hated each other. Shylock agreed to lend him money but on one condition. If he failed to repay the money in three month's time, Shylock would cut a pound of flesh from any part of Antonio's body. Antonio willingly agreed and signed a bond.</p>

                            <p>Bassanio went to Belmont to visit Portia. Before his death, Portia's father had planned to find a good husband for his daughter. He had three caskets made: one of gold, one of silver, and one of lead. The suitor who chose the casket with Portia's portrait in it would marry her.</p>
                            <p>The prince of Morocco chose the gold casket, thinking it would hold a precious picture, but found a skull. The prince of Spain chose the silver casket, thinking he would get what he deserved, but found a picture of a fool. Both left disappointed.</p>
                            <p>Then it was Bassanio's turn. He thought, "Appearances are often misleading," and chose the plain lead casket. On opening it, he found the portrait of Portia inside. Bassanio and Portia got married. But soon their happiness turned into sorrow. A letter came from Antonio saying all his ships were lost and he could not pay Shylock. He asked Bassanio to visit him before he died.</p>

                           <p>The Duke requested Shylock to be merciful, but Shylock refused, demanding his pound of flesh as the law was on his side. Bassanio offered twice the money, but Shylock still refused. The Duke was sorry but could do nothing. Suddenly, a young lawyer, Doctor Balthazar, entered to defend Antonio. This lawyer was actually Portia in disguise.</p>
                           <p>Portia gave a beautiful speech on mercy, saying it blesses both the giver and receiver, but Shylock paid no heed. She confirmed that the law was on Shylock's side and told Antonio to prepare himself. Delighted, Shylock approached Antonio with a knife. But just as he was about to cut, Portia stopped him. She cried, "Wait! The bond gives you flesh, but no mention of blood. You cannot shed a single drop of blood, or the state will take all your property."</p>
                           <p>Shylock knew it was impossible. Defeated, he left the courtroom, and Antonio's life was saved.</p>
